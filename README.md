# Git Commands
This repository contains a list of GIT commands and explanations of how they work. The scenario
section describes how the combination of git commands can be used in different scenarios. The
reference section list several examples on how a single git command can be used in a number
of different ways.

## Overview
> This page came to life after I decided to learn git in a lot more details. I used numerous sources
like books, tutorials and online courses and made notes as I started to learn git in detail. The reason
for publishing yet another repository of git commands is because of the Feynman Technique. According to
Richard Feynman, you learn by teaching somebody else a topic in simple terms.
